**Guidelines:**

  * Papers will be sent at least a week in advance by presenter to list serve


  * Presenters should select an “introductory” reading on the topic, and then something more advanced/cutting edge/applied (when possible)


  * Presenters must keep the presentations inside 1 hour (room constriants), encouraging discussion and questions is **strongly preferred**.


  * Respondents listed (students taking RG for credit) will write blog post on efish.zoology.msu.edu/msu_ngs_methods to summarize and discuss the presentation (1000-1500 words), link readings, and illustrate with graphics.


  * Students taking RG for credit are additionally required to edit, revise and add to 2-3 of these posts through the semester
