Congratulations to Alyssa Saunders, PhD student in the MSU Electric Fish Lab, on receiving the 2025 Graduate Student Award for Science Communication and Outreach from MSU’s Office of Outreach and Engagement!

This prestigious award recognizes Alyssa’s creative and impactful efforts to connect science with diverse audiences—from organizing Biology on Tap and science panels at pop culture conventions, to hosting events on animal behavior at the Constellation Cat Café, and designing crochet patterns of model organisms.

She’s also engaged K–12 students through local school science nights and GMSD, and shared her research on podcasts like The Sci-Files and Journeys of Scientists. Alyssa recently brought her passion for advocacy to Washington, D.C., attending the AAAS Catalyzing Advocacy in Science and Engineering workshop.

Her work exemplifies the power of combining science, creativity, and public engagement—congratulations, Alyssa!
