Congratulations to Jason Gallant, on receiving the 2025 Mentorship Award from the Undergraduate Senior Class Council!

Dr. Gallant considers this award to be especially meaningful by the fact that it was student-nominated. This award reflects his ongoing commitment to fostering inclusive, supportive, and intellectually vibrant learning and research environments. These are core lab values that he strives to uphold through mentorship, teaching, and community building at MSU and beyond.
