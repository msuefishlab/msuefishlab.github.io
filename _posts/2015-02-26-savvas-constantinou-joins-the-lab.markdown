Savvas Constantinou (BS Trinity College '12; MS Central Connecticut State University '14) will be joining the Ph.D. program in Integrative Biology at Michigan State University in Fall 2015.  Savvas did his master's thesis working on classical conditioning in planarian flatworms, and is currently a technician in the laboratory of Terri Williams at Trinity College.  We are very excited to have him join our lab, where he will be working on some exciting projects on the evolution and development of electric organs!  Welcome Savvas!
