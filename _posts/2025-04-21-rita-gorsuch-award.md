Congratulations to Rita Gorsuch, on receiving first place in the Cell Biology, Genetics and Genomics category at the [2025 MSU UURAF](https://urca.msu.edu/files/forums/48/award/UURAF%202025%20Award%20Winners-1.pdf)!

Rita's poster, entitled "WHAT'S ON THE MENU? DIET DIVERSITY IN RAPIDLY SPECIATING GROUPS OF WEAKLY ELECTRIC FISH" examined gut content biodiversity in Paramormyrops electric fish we collected from Gabon in 2019, and she'll be working with us over the summer to write up these exciting results soon!
