iNaturalist is a really cool project sponsored by the California Academy of Sciences and National Geographic, where you can use your smartphone to help catalog biodiversity.  We created a project for our collections in Gabon from last summer as a way of contributing to this amazing resource.  Check out our fish-- there's only a few for now, but we'll be updating it over time...
